# 🔗 WasteChain: Immutable Industrial Waste Audit System

Welcome to WasteChain, a blockchain-powered solution for transparent industrial waste management! Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, this project creates an immutable ledger to track waste generation, disposal, and audits. It reduces illegal dumping by enabling verifiable reporting, compliance checks, and stakeholder transparency—solving real-world environmental issues like unregulated waste handling that harms ecosystems and public health.

## ✨ Features

📝 Register and log industrial waste generation with timestamps  
🚛 Track secure disposal methods and locations  
🔍 Submit and verify independent audits  
✅ Automated compliance verification to flag violations  
📊 Generate transparent reports for regulators and the public  
⚠️ Alert system for potential illegal activities  
🔐 Role-based access for companies, auditors, and authorities  
🌍 Immutable records to prevent tampering and ensure accountability  

## 🛠 How It Works

WasteChain uses 8 interconnected Clarity smart contracts for modularity, security, and scalability:

1. **WasteRegistry**: Logs waste generation details (type, quantity, timestamp) with a unique hash.  
2. **DisposalTracker**: Records disposal methods, locations, and responsible parties.  
3. **AuditManager**: Enables auditors to submit and timestamp audit reports.  
4. **ComplianceChecker**: Verifies waste handling against regulatory standards and flags violations.  
5. **ReportGenerator**: Creates public-facing reports for transparency.  
6. **AlertSystem**: Triggers alerts for suspicious activities (e.g., unregistered disposal).  
7. **RoleManager**: Manages access control for companies, auditors, and regulators.  
8. **DataVault**: Stores immutable records and metadata for all transactions.

**For Companies**  
- Register waste via `WasteRegistry` with a SHA-256 hash of waste details.  
- Log disposal details in `DisposalTracker` (e.g., recycling, landfill, incineration).  

**For Auditors**  
- Submit audit reports via `AuditManager`.  
- Verify compliance using `ComplianceChecker`.  

**For Regulators and Public**  
- Access reports via `ReportGenerator`.  
- Monitor alerts from `AlertSystem` for potential illegal dumping.

**Key Workflow**  
1. A company registers waste (e.g., 500kg chemical waste, timestamped).
2. Disposal details are logged (e.g., transported to certified facility).
3. Auditors submit independent reports, verified against compliance rules.
4. Public reports are generated, and alerts flag any discrepancies.
